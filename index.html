            <h1>The Shepherd Boy & the Wolf</h1>
            <p>
                The Boy Who Cried Wolf, a fable that teaches a lesson about
                lying, uses a shepherd boy, his sheep and a wolf to convey a
                powerful message. After the Shepherd Boy tricks the very people
                who were willing to help him, the villagers are not sympathetic
                toward him when a wolf actually appears.

                Liars are not believed even when they speak the truth.

        <h3>The Tale</h3>
        <p>
            A <strong>Shepherd Boy</strong> tended his master's Sheep near a
            dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the
            pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk
            to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and
            thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a
            plan to amuse himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack
            the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though
            he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran
            toward the village shouting at the top of his voice,
            <em>"Wolf! Wolf!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their
            work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they
            got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the
            trick he had played on them.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted,
            <em>"Wolf! Wolf!"</em> Again the Villagers ran to help him, only
            to be laughed at again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and
            the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really
            did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting
            <em>"Wolf! Wolf!"</em> But though the Villagers heard the cry,
            they did not run to help him as they had before.
            <em>"He cannot fool us again,"</em> they said.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped
            away into the forest.
